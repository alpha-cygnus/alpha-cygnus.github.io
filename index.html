<h1>alpha-cygnus.github.io</h1>

Here we have a set of small projects that mainly serve as a tool to learn what a modern browser can do and have fun in the process.

<ul>
<li><a href="gyaku-hanmi/">gyaku hanmi</a> &mdash; generator of aidkido technique names. Does this by randomly generating phrases by a grammar. The grammar needs an update as it reflects my knowledge of aikido after mere 4 months of study.
<li><a href="fatou/">fatou</a> &mdash; an implementation of fractal drawing algorythms using web gl and fragment shaders. Julia/Fatou sets and Newton root search methods.

<li><a href="mhu/">MHU</a> - experimental synth builder loosely based on matrix idea of VCS3 synthesizer. Uses Web Audio with Tone.js.

<li><a href="bald/">bald</a> - Balda game solver, experiment with es6 generators.

<li><a href="rev/">rev</a> - a Reversi (Othello) game implementation, uses require.js, intended as a playground with bot algorythms, but so far the best is quite dumb.

<li><a href="bassc/?load=test-ui">BassC</a> - experimental framework for creating sounds and music using webaudio, which includes its own language (with parser and compiler to JS) and abilities to program sounds, sequences (melodies) and basic GUI. Work in progress.

</ul>
